				<h1>CS 498: Data Visualization</h1>
				
				<h2>DataSet</h2>
				<p>World Development Indicators - http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/</p>
				
				<h2>Messaging</h2>
				<p>This visualization is an interactive slideshow which talks about the population of top 5 most populated countries of the 
				world in 2018 (China, India, USA, Indonesia & Pakistan). I have looked at the WDI dataset for this narration. I have presented a population growth trend for these countries 
				in last 60 years. Once we see the trend for population growth, the next scene depicts the corresponding population growth in
				rural & urban population for these countries. This will give user an idea that the country like India where the population is increasing
				for both rural & urban and would surpass China (most populated country in 2018). The population growth trend is always on a rise for 
				urban areas for all these countries.
				
				<h2>Narrative Structure</h2>
				<p>This visualization follows the "Interactive Slide Show" structure. The user is given the visual information about the data based on the scenes depicted in the story.
				The user has the option to drilldown in the details (mouse over the line charts to view & compare the population of the countries for a particular year, 
				filter the data for the "urban" & "rural" population growth per country) or move on to the next scene. This visualization tends to focus more on stronger messaging
				rather than free form exploration.</p>
				
				<h2>Visual Structure</h2>
				<p>Structure - The data is presented to the user in a simple form that present the information clearly whether it is depicting quantitative & nominal data with bar 
				charts or quantitative & quantitative data with line charts, clear use of labels/text for frames to communicate the details</p>
				<p>Highlight - Important information that I want to present is highighted using the annotations and axis labels</p>
				<p>Transition - I have made sure that the user is not disoriented from scene to scene. I have used the same dimension for the svg canvas, the contours used to
				depict different countries, the font of the text.</p>

				<h2>Scenes</h2>
				<p>I have developed the scenes as the slides in the presentation and added the following scenes-
					<ul>
						<li>Scene 1- Depict the population for top 5 most populated countries of the world. I have used bar charts to represent the data with tooltip to display 
						the population data on demand.</li>
						<li>Scene 2- This scene presents the population growth for last six decades for these  5 countries.</li>
						<li>Scene 3- Once user get an idea for the overall growth trend, I present the growth trend for rural & urban population and user has the option to filter based on country.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>The scenes are ordered to tell the story about the population growth for few top most populated countries & answer the questions that user might have,
				looking at scene 1, scene 2 & scene 3 respectively. The user will come to conclusion that the country where there is increase in both rural & urban
				population like India is on the path to be the most populated country.
				
				<h2>Annotations</h2>
				<p>I have used a text to convey the important message for the scene. The other way of communicating the annotations used are clear labels for the axis and tooltip
					is used in few scenes to provide the detail on demand information. This will help user to get a high level message from the scene. Annotations like "Neutral Growth" 
					is added to the graph to convey the message about rural vs urban population growth trend. The annotations change from scene to scene but not within a scene.</p>
				
				<h2>Parameters</h2>
				<p> Parameters allows user to transition from one view to another. In the case of rural and urban population scene, I have provided the parameter
					with the dropdown option (Country) at the bottom of the chart. Each selected option will result in a different state of the scene.</p>
				
				<h2>Triggers</h2>
				<p>Triggers are used to interact with parameters and change the state of the scene. In our visualization story, the trigger is selection in dropdown (Country) in rural and urban 
				population growth scene to select the data for particular country. I have added it at the bottom of the chart unlike the previous scenes to attract user's 
				attention. I still used the same colors to make sure user is not disoriented in the transition.</p>
